# html-uri-crawler
A random-walk web crawler that collects unique HTML URIs that are larger than 1000 bytes, starting from a given seed page.   Originally created for the CS432: Web Science course at Old Dominion University, this project demonstrates practical web-data collection, link filtering, and crawler control using Python requests library and BeautifulSoup4.
